## Deployed on https://masha-girya.github.io/codempire-cafe/#/home/dishes

### Server and data base are hosted on a free trial with low speed, so you have to wait 1 minute for the first data fetching

## Everything else is simple:

### `yarn install`

The project is using yarn, so just type this command to install all packages (yarn -v 1.22.19)
If there is some issues with network timeout, than run:
`yarn install --network-timeout 1000000000`

To start the frontend:
### `cd packages/frontend/ && yarn start`

To connect to the backend. By default frontend uses hosted server as Base link. To change it to local server just go to the:
1. packages/frontend/constants-app/api-constants.ts
2. comment `BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3333'`
3. uncomment `BASE_URL: 'https://codempire-cafe.onrender.com'`

Cool! It's ready now!ðŸš€
